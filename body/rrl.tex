	\textcite{Yuan2020} conducted a computational parametric study in order to evaluate the impact of urbanization in Singapore.
	Using Computational Fluid Dynamics, they examined how anthropogenic heat disperses given the city's urban morphology.
	The authors discovered that heat is hard to disperse if there is a lack of incoming wind.
	Based on the findings, the authors created a practical modeling tool in order to help with urban planning. 
	The Geographic Information System-based tool estimates how much impact anthropogenic heat has on the city's ambient temperature.
