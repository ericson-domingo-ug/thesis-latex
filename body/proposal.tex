\section{Preliminary Simulations}
	In order to test if RegCM5 is working on the laboratory's workstation,
		a preliminary simulation was conducted.
	The domain of the simulation is Luzon, centered on Manila, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:proposal-domain}.
	The domain has an area of $\num{130}$ by $\num{124}$ grid cells, with a $\qty{3}{km}$ resolution.
	Data for initial and boundary condition were dated from March to September 1990,
		and the simulation itself is from March to May 1990.
