\section{Urban Heat Island}

	\section{Categories of Urban Heat Island}
	
	There are two types of urban heat based on how they are formed and how high they reach:
	surface urban heat islands and atmospheric urban heat islands.
	The latter is subdivided into two more classifications:
	the canopy layer and the boundary layer (\cite{Zhou2018}).
	
	Surface urban heat islands refer to the warmer surface of urbanized areas compared to the temperature of rural surfaces, and is primarily measured by satellite thermal remote sensing data (\cite{Zhou2018}). 
	How hot a surface can reach depends on its properties.
	Dry and exposed surfaces such as roofs and pavements can become significantly hotter than the air, while shaded and moist surfaces remain as hot as the air (\cite{Khan2021}). 
	
	Atmospheric urban heat islands refer to the warmer air temperature of urbanized areas compared to the air temperature of rural areas.
	
	\section{Factors Causing Urban Heat Islands}
	
	Different climatic and nonclimatic factors are responsible for causing urban heat islands.
	\citeauthor{Bridgman1995} (\citeyear{Bridgman1995}, as cited in \cite{Khan2021}) lists five major ways in which urbanization can influence a city's climate:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item by replacing natural surfaces with asphalts, concrete, and glasses;
		\item by replacing natural shape with blocky, angular, towering structures;
		\item by releasing anthropogenic heat into the urban atmosphere;
		\item by routing flow of surface runoff and preventing infiltration; and
		\item by emitting pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
	\end{itemize}
