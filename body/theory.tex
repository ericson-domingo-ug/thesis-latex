\section{Categories of Urban Heat Island}

There are two types of urban heat based on how they are formed and how high they reach. 
The first are surface urban heat islands, and
the second are atmospheric urban heat islands.
The latter is subdivided into two more classifications:
the canopy layer and the boundary layer (\cite{Zhou2018}).
