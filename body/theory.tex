\section{Categories of Urban Heat Island}

There are two types of urban heat based on how they are formed and how high they reach:
surface urban heat islands and atmospheric urban heat islands.
The latter is subdivided into two more classifications:
the canopy layer and the boundary layer (\cite{Zhou2018}).

\section{Factors Causing Urban Heat Islands}

Different climatic and nonclimatic factors are responsible for causing urban heat islands.
\citeauthor{Bridgman1995} (\citeyear{Bridgman1995}, as cited in \cite{Khan2021}) lists five major ways in which urbanization can influence a city's climate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item by replacing natural surfaces with asphalts, concrete, and glasses;
	\item by replacing natural shape with blocky, angular, towering structures;
	\item by releasing anthropogenic heat into the urban atmosphere;
	\item by routing flow of surface runoff and preventing infiltration; and
	\item by emitting pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
\end{itemize}
