\section{Categories of Urban Heat Island}

There are two types of urban heat based on how they are formed and how high they reach:
surface urban heat islands and atmospheric urban heat islands.
The latter is subdivided into two more classifications:
the canopy layer and the boundary layer (\cite{Zhou2018}).
