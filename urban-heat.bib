  abstract  = {Between 1930 and 2030, the world’s population will have flipped from 70% rural to 70%
        urban. While much has been written about the impacts of climate change and mitigation of its
        effects on individual buildings or infrastructure, this book is one of the first to focus on
        the resilience of whole cities. It covers a broad range of area-wide disaster-level impacts,
        including drought, heatwaves, flooding, storms and air quality, which many of our cities are
        ill-adapted to cope with, and unless we can increase the resilience of our urban areas then
        much of our current building stock may become uninhabitable.
                  Climate Resilience in Urban Environments provides a detailed overview of
        the risks for urban areas, including those risks to human health as well as to building
        integrity, the physical processes involved, and presents key information in which way the
        risks can be reduced and urban areas made more resilient.},
